# Hi there! <3

Thanks for checking out this repo!

This is where I intend to keep all of my future Powercord-related CSS snippets. Maybe if there are also snippets that can be used elsewhere, that'll change. 

If any of the snippets break, feel free to ping me on a Discord server or something (I'm sometimes around in the Powercord server), or just DM me! 

### *Hey, can I...*

*Although you're not obligated to,* If you want to (re)use some of the CSS in a project of your own, please let me know! Or at least, write my name in somewhere in your project, haha.

If possible, make your project open source, too; I managed to learn enough about CSS (and other things) because I had the privilege of studying and understanding other people's code - I hope you can pass on that spirit of sharing your creations in your project, too :) 

Thanks again for reading, and have a nice day <3

# CSS Snippets

### Improved user profile popup

Makes user profile popups a little neater while also making it more compact!

I was always a little annoyed how little you could see your own banner, while how much padding and spacing everything took up... it felt very inefficient and bloated.

I cleaned up some of the padding, and I shifted the banner, avatar and name in a way I thought resembles other "namecard" styles in games and other social media platforms uwu

###### TODOs, if possible: 
- Improve activity section
- Better separators?
- Remove separator if on top
